								<h3>Projects</h3>
								<h4>Azure Serverless Portfolio & DevOps Pipeline</h4>
								<p>Deployed an Azure Serverless Portfolio & DevOps Pipeline. Built as a capstone to the Cloud Resume Challenge, this project is a production-grade, end-to-end serverless 
									application hosted on Azure. The architecture features a static website—developed with HTML/CSS and hosted via Azure Storage—and a global delivery layer managed through 
									Azure Front Door for high availability and HTTPS security. The backend utilizes a Python-based Azure Function API that securely interacts with a Cosmos DB NoSQL database 
									to manage real-time visitor tracking. To ensure code reliability, I implemented unit testing using Pytest to validate logic before deployment.</p>
									
								<p>Moving beyond manual configuration, I managed the entire environment as Infrastructure as Code (IaC) using Terraform. I refactored initial resource exports into a modular, 
									multi-folder structure that separates two resource groups, utilizing variables for enhanced security and portability. To enable a professional DevOps workflow, I migrated 
									the Terraform state from a local environment to a Remote Backend in Azure Blob Storage. This centralized the "source of truth," ensuring that my local development environment 
									in VS Code stays perfectly synced with Azure. Currently, I use GitHub Actions to automate the deployment of my application code, ensuring that every push from VS Code is 
									seamlessly updated in the live environment, while maintaining a stable, "zero-drift" infrastructure through controlled Terraform updates.</p>

								<p>To align with industry best practices, I refactored my infrastructure from a flat structure into two distinct logical layers: a Frontend tier for static assets and a Backend tier 
									for API logic and data. By moving the Azure Cosmos DB into the same Resource Group as the Azure Function, I created a cohesive "Data & Logic" service boundary that simplified IAM 
									(Identity and Access Management) and improved overall manageability. Since moving resources in the Azure Portal creates "state drift" in Terraform, I executed a complex State 
									Migration Workflow to prevent data loss; this involved using terraform state rm to release the database from the Frontend state and terraform import to re-parent the account, SQL 
									containers, and RBAC roles into the Backend module. Despite shell-specific path conversion challenges in Git Bash, I successfully achieved a 100% stable, zero-downtime migration that 
									preserved all existing visitor data while establishing a professional, service-oriented architecture.</p>

								<h3>Professional</h3>
								<p>I have over 10 years of experience in Telecommunications. I transitioned into IT about 4 years ago Sand have since worked as a MSP technician, an IT Analyst and a Project Engineer. 
									Skilled in Infrastructure-as-Code (IaC), containerization (Docker, Kubernetes), CI/CD, and cloud migrations. Experienced in optimizing infrastructure costs and 
									improving system performance. Certified in Azure and continuously expanding expertise in AWS, scripting, monitoring, and DevOps best practices. I am always eager 
									to adopt new technologies and contribute to innovative cloud solutions. Seeking a collaborative opportunity, in a fast-paced environment where my attention to detail, 
									motivation, and resourcefulness can have a meaningful impact.</p>

								<h3>Leisure</h3>
								<p>When I’m not labbing in the cloud or automating Azure and AWS services, I prioritize staying active and spending time with my family. I’m a firm believer in continuous 
									learning—whether it's mastering a new scripting language or exploring a new culture. My wife, Jackie, and I share a passion for travel; our annual adventures have taken 
									us from the historical streets of France to the coasts of Mexico and the Dominican Republic. In the summer, you’ll likely find me at a pool, playing badminton or enjoying 
									a long walk with friends and family.</p>
